Package: mcreplicate
Description: Multi-core replication function to make it easier to do fast 
  Monte Carlo simulation. Based on the mcreplicate() function from the 
  'rethinking' package. The 'rethinking' package requires installing 'rstan', 
  which is onerous to install, while also not adding capabilities to this 
  function.
